# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What is Qyoo?
Qyoo is the company that designed the qyoo, a smarter, more dynamic version of 2D barcodes. They were designed to deliver personalized, real-time experiences based on contextual data like location, time of day, and device motion. Unlike traditional QR codes, qyoos adapt to each user's environment, creating interactive and tailored interactions.

### How is Qyoo different from QR codes?
While QR codes direct users to a static webpage, qyoos take full advantage of mobile device capabilities. Qyoos offer real-time, context-aware experiences based on metadata, such as behavioral patterns, weather conditions, and even language preferences. This enables brands to create more personalized and engaging interactions.

### Can I use qyoos for my own projects?
Yes! Qyoos are now open-source. You can access the code through our GitHub repository, modify it, and integrate qyoos into your own projects. The only restriction is that we retain control over the qyoo shape (the distinct circle with squared edge) to avoid confusion in public use.

### How do Qyoos use metadata?
Qyoos leverage metadata from mobile devices, such as the user’s location, time of day, and device motion sensors (like accelerometers and gyroscopes), to create a personalized experience. For example, a user scanning a qyoo in the morning may receive different content than they would in the evening.

### Is Qyoo secure and privacy-conscious?
Yes. Qyoos allow users to control the information they share, ensuring that data is used only to enhance their experience, not intrude on their privacy. The information shared is up to the user, and qyoos focus on creating meaningful, privacy-conscious interactions.

### How do I get involved with Qyoo development?
You can visit our open-source GitHub repository at **[github.com/qyoocode](https://github.com/qyoocode)** to explore the codebase. We encourage contributions, whether you want to improve existing features, suggest new ones, or help evolve the Qyoo ecosystem. We are also open to conversations about your ideas!

### Can I customize qyoos for my business or product?
Absolutely! The open-source code gives you the freedom to create customized qyoos that fit your business needs. Whether you’re integrating qyoos into an app, a marketing campaign, or an event, the possibilities are endless.

### What’s the future of Qyoo?
We’re transitioning to a decentralized model where qyoos are stored on the blockchain, giving users full ownership and control. Our vision is to allow users to take qyoos into new territories, enabling innovation without being bound to a centralized system. The future of qyoos lies in empowering users to create their own experiences.

### How does Qyoo handle updates or new features?
We rely on the community to suggest and develop new features. We encourage you to share your ideas and submit pull requests through our GitHub repository. Additionally, we provide guidance on better messaging strategies and evolving use cases, always looking ahead to future innovations.

### How can qyoos integrate with augmented reality or gamification?
Qyoos can be easily integrated with AR platforms and game mechanics to deliver rich, interactive experiences. Whether it's a scavenger hunt, a 3D model overlay, or dynamic storytelling, qyoos enable businesses to create interactive and immersive experiences through real-time, contextual data.
