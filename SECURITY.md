# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at Qyoo and appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing any security vulnerabilities you may find. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it to us by creating a new GitHub issue in the affected repository.

### Guidelines for Responsible Disclosure

Please follow these guidelines when reporting a vulnerability:

1. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
2. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it.
3. Do not engage in any activities that could potentially harm the application, its users, or the data it processes.

## Security Practices

- Our open source projects are intended to help build a community, share code, teach others, and gain insights from outside our organization.
- No sensitive data is stored in our open source projects, and our cybersecurity team routinely reviews them.
- We do not currently implement authentication in our open source projects.
- We follow PCI compliance guidelines in our projects.

Thank you for your contributions to Qyoo's open source projects and for helping us maintain a secure environment for our community.
